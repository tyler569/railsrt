## railsrt

This is a pretty crazy idea - it's a dynamic routing protocol that uses HTTP as a transport protocol. This is implemented as a Rails app with no database, all routing state is stored in a singleton model, RouteTable.

I wouldn't use this in anything that matters, it's just a weird experiment.
